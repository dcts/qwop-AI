Repo to make an AI learn how to play the [QWOP game](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html).

### Evolution
Idea is to make an evolutionary algorithm
- a keypress pattern represents an individual of a population
- fitness function is the score/time
- random starting point -> mutation and reproduction to increase fitness

### Problems to solve
- [ ] control the keyboard remotely (done in `ruby` with [selenium-webdriver gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver/versions/3.142.6))
- [ ] get game data
